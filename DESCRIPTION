Description: Nonparametric estimation and inference of a non-decreasing monotone hazard
    ratio from a right censored survival dataset.  The
    estimator is based on a generalized Grenander typed estimator, and the
    inference procedure relies on direct plugin estimation of a first order derivative.  More
    details please refer to the paper "Nonparametric inference under a monotone
    hazard ratio order" by Y. Wu and T. Westling (2023) <doi:10.1214/23-EJS2173>.
